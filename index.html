            <h2>Details</h2>
            <p>I'm actively engaged in the design and deployment of deep neural networks within embedded systems, particularly focusing on assistive technologies. Currently, I'm advancing my studies with a master's degree from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, where I'm part of the School of Artificial Intelligence (ScAI). My foundation in this field is built on an engineering degree in Electronics and Communication from Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology, Delhi. My experience spans developing digital-analog circuits, robotics, and machine learning models. </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Drowsiness Detection Using Statistical Modeling:</strong> Contributed to a team that engineered a novel computer vision model to detect drowsiness in real-time. Unlike traditional models, ours uniquely adjusts to an individual's ethnic facial features and learns from new user behavior, making it highly adaptable and accurate.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>AI-based Obstacle Avoidance Robot:</strong> Developed an autonomous obstacles avoidance robot. The project spanned initial data collection through manual operation, followed by extensive data cleaning and machine learning model training. The deployment of this robot can aid in surveillance operations.
