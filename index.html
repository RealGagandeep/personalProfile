            <h2>Details</h2>
            <p>I am a researcher designing and deploying deep neural networks on embedded systems for use in assistive technologies. Currently I am pursuing my masters from Indian Institute of Technology Delhi in School of Artificial Intelligence (ScAI). My embedded background comes from my Engineering degree in Electronics and communication from Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology, Delhi . I have worked on digital-analog circuits, robots, and learning based models. </p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Drowsiness detection using statistical modelling: I was part of a team that designed and implemented a computer vision model which could tell the drowsiness of the person, this project was different from conventional ML models as it could adapt to the person's ethnic facial features and also adapt to new users' drowsiness profile. This was a pure statistics based project.</li>
                <li>AI based obstacle avoidance robot: I was part of a team that made an obstacle-avoidance robot with an ML algorithm driving the motion. The whole project included a mechanism of data collection while manually running the robot, cleaning the data, making an ML algorithm then fitting it to train on the given data, and then deployment of the robot for surveillance purposes.</li>
